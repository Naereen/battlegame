This repository is [my](https://github.com/Naereen/) fork of [James Powell's](https://github.com/dutc/) [battlegame](https://github.com/dutc/battlegame) challenge.

## About the challenge
- The [explainations about the game](Instructions.md) are copied from his repository.

## About my solution
- You can find my solutions here: [`battleserver.py`](battleserver.py) and [`battleplayer.py`](battleplayer.py).
- My "server" script implements perfectly what was asked by the exercise, and my "client" script implements a quite naive heuristic: it plays randomly and only tries to keep hitting a ship when it first hit it (my experiments showed it wins in about 60% to 75% lesser number of plays in comparison to the naive purely uniform strategy).
- Both scripts [stand on the shoulder on giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants): [the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/) (`sys`, `string.ascii_uppercase`, `collections.OrderedDict`, `pprint.pprint`), [the Numpy package](http://www.numpy.org/) and the :sparkles: awesome [docopt package](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) for command-line handling. (see [reqirements.txt](requirements.txt)).
